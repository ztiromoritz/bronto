Last night, i couldn't sleep. 

I ate som seeweed and took a walk around my families place. 

I looked at the sky. And suddenly a huge light brightens the night.

It moved real fast across the firmament and headed towards the wild lands.

It disappeared from my sight. Half an hour later i heard an enormorous thunder and the night was brighten the second time.
